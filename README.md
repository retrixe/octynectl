# octynectl

Command-line interface to control Octyne.

## Quick Start

`sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/octynectl https://github.com/retrixe/octynectl/releases/latest/download/octynectl-linux-x86_64 && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/octynectl`

You should be able to run `octynectl` now.

## Configuration

Currently, there is no way to configure `octynectl`. Octynectl will only work with Octyne running on the default port 42069 with the Unix socket API enabled (and accessible by the current user, of course).
